# Product prices automatically calculated after adding the  product into cart.


In order to calculate your add-to-cart rate, first determine a given period. Then divide the number of sessions where a user added a product to their cart by the total number of site sessions during that period. Multiply that number by 100 to get a percentage, and you have your average add-to-cart rate.

Adjusting our expectations will go a long way in helping flow with the winds of change, by making us more adaptable.
